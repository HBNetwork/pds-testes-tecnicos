"""
We call an array switching if all numbers in even positions are equal and all numbers in odd positions are equal.

For example: [3,-7,3,-7,3] and [4,4,4] are switching, but [5,5,4,5,4] and [-3,2,3] are not switching

What is the length of the longest switching slice (continuous fragment) in a given array A?

Write a function:

  class Soluction { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the length of the longest switching slice in A.

Examples:

1. Given A = [3,2,3,2,3] the function should return 5, because the whole array is switching.

2. Given A = [7,4,-2,4,-2,-9], the function should return 4. The longest switching slice is [4,-2,4,-2].

3. Given A = [7, -5, -5, -5, 7, -1, 7], then function should return 3. There are two switching slices of equal length: [-5,-5,-5] and [7,-1,7]

4. Given A = [4], the function should return 1. A single-element slice is also a switching slice.

Write an eficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  . N is an integer within the range[1..100,000];
  . each element of array is an integer within the range[-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000]
